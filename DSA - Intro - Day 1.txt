# DSA 

Q) What is DSA ?
A) Data structures - how we store the data
   Algorithms - how we operate on that data

# Time Complexity
 -> Measures how much time an algorithm runs as input size grows
 -> expressed by Big (O) notation
Ex:
 -> print("hi")  - O(1)
 -> for i in n:  - O(n)
 -> nested loops - O(n square), O(n cube) .. 
 -> Binary search - O(logn)
 -> Merge sort   - O (n logn)

# Space complexity 
-> Measures how much memory an algorithm uses
-> includes variables, data structures and function call stack(recursion)
Ex: 
-> constant variables   - O(1)
-> size of array n      - O(n)
-> Recursive call stack (depth n) - O(n)
