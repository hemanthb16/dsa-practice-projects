# Chat GPT array learning practice programs

# Reverse an array
- take two pointers to store left and right indexes
- iterate array
- will take left index element and kept in right index element and vise versa (swapping)
- same process needs to done for every index until we reach middle of the array (until left < right true)
Time: O(N) 
Space: O(1)

# check array is sorted
- iterate array
- take is_sorted inbuild function from python as True
- check next element is less than previous element
- break and conclude array is not sorted and assign is_sorted = False
- otherwise array is sorted
Time: O(N) 
Space: O(1)

# remove duplicates from sorted array 
- take 1 pointer(write) to keep index of distinct array (this index will use to replace distinct values)
- iterate from second element as first element is always distinct (read index = 1 and write index = 1)
- verify present element and previous element are not equal, if then replace write index element with read index       element 
- increase write index by 1, otherwise write index will be same 
- repeat same process till end of the array
- take arr till write index as write index array will have distinct values (arr = arr[:write])
